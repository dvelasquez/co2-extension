# CO2-extension (WORK IN PROGRESS)
This is a Chrome Extension that calculates the amount of co2 released to the atmosphere by transferring
the page assets over the network.

## How it works
1. Injects a small script that uses the Performance API, getting information about the transferSize of the assets in 
the page with `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')`
2. Sums only the `transferSize` of each entry in the Performance API
3. Once a day checks the user location with based on the IP address, using the `https://freegeoip.app/json/` API.
In this case, we only need the Country Code.
4. Using the library [bytes-to-co2](https://github.com/dvelasquez/bytes-to-co2) we calculate the CO2 based
on the Country the user is and the size of the page.

## Caveats
CORS: It only get the `transferSize` for assets with CORS or are in the same domain you are visiting.
Due to this, almost all the 3rd parties don't get reported nor evaluated.

## TODO
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Create Icons
- [ ] Setup deploy pipeline
- [ ] Make it available in the Chrome Store
